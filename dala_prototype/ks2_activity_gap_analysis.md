# KS2 English (Years 3-4) - Activity Gap Analysis

This document analyzes the existing proposed learning activities in `ks2_english_curriculum_expansion_plan.md` to identify curriculum areas already covered and potential gaps for new activities, in preparation for Task 2.4.2 (Create and digitize 5-7 new learning activities).

## Review of Existing Proposed Activities (from `ks2_english_curriculum_expansion_plan.md`)

The existing plan proposes 8 activities:

**I. Reading Comprehension**
*   **Activity 1: Character Detective:** Focuses on inferring characters’ feelings, thoughts, motives and justifying with evidence; predicting.
*   **Activity 2: Prediction Portal:** Focuses on predicting what might happen from details stated and implied.

**II. Writing - Composition**
*   **Activity 3: Story Deconstruction & Idea Generation:** Focuses on planning writing by discussing similar texts (structure, vocabulary, grammar) and recording ideas.
*   **Activity 4: Sentence Builder & Story Weaver:** Focuses on drafting/writing by composing/rehearsing sentences orally, building vocabulary/sentence structures, organizing paragraphs, and creating narrative elements (settings, characters, plot).

**III. Writing - Vocabulary, Grammar and Punctuation**
*   **Activity 5: Conjunction Connection & Tense Traveller:** Focuses on using conjunctions for multi-clause sentences, present perfect vs. past tense, and conjunctions/adverbs/prepositions for time/cause.
*   **Activity 6: Punctuation Power-Up:** Focuses on commas after fronted adverbials, possessive apostrophes with plural nouns, and punctuating direct speech.

**IV. Reading - Word Reading & Spelling (Integrated)**
*   **Activity 7: Word Builder Challenge:** Focuses on applying knowledge of root words, prefixes, suffixes (etymology/morphology) for reading and understanding new words; using prefixes/suffixes.
*   **Activity 8: Homophone Maze & Spelling Bee Bonanza:** Focuses on spelling homophones and commonly misspelt words.

**V. Spoken Language (Integrated where appropriate)**
*   **General Approach:** Suggests integrating spoken language through discussion prompts, role-play, presentation prep, and voice input in other activities, rather than standalone activities.

## Analysis of Curriculum Coverage by Existing Activities:

The 8 activities provide good initial coverage across the main areas of Reading, Writing, and Grammar/Vocabulary/Spelling. Spoken language is addressed through integration.

**Strengths of Current Coverage:**
*   **Reading Comprehension:** Inference, prediction, and justification are covered.
*   **Writing Composition:** Planning, drafting, sentence construction, paragraphing, and narrative elements are addressed.
*   **Vocabulary, Grammar, Punctuation:** Key Y3/4 concepts like conjunctions, tenses, fronted adverbials, possessive apostrophes, and direct speech are included.
*   **Word Reading/Spelling:** Prefixes/suffixes, homophones, and common misspellings are targeted.

**Potential Areas for New Activities (to reach the 5-7 *new* activities target for Task 2.4.2):**

Based on the general aims in `ks2_english_curriculum_expansion_plan.md`, the following areas could be targeted for *new* activities to ensure broader coverage or offer different types of engagement:

1.  **Reading - Deeper Comprehension & Non-Fiction:**
    *   Identifying main ideas from *more than one paragraph* and summarising them (currently, Activity 1 & 2 are more focused on inference/prediction within specific excerpts).
    *   Identifying how language, structure, and *presentation* contribute to meaning (presentation elements are not explicitly targeted).
    *   Retrieving and *recording* information from non-fiction (current activities are fiction-focused).

2.  **Writing - Broader Range & Evaluation:**
    *   Writing for different purposes/audiences or in different non-narrative forms (e.g., instructions, explanations, recounts, poetry - current focus is mainly narrative).
    *   Evaluating and editing: Specifically activities that focus on *assessing the effectiveness of their own and others’ writing and suggesting improvements* or *proposing changes to grammar and vocabulary to improve consistency*. (Activity 4 touches on drafting, but dedicated editing/evaluation activities could be beneficial).
    *   Handwriting: While mentioned in aims, no specific DALA activity is proposed. This might be harder to digitize effectively but could be considered for simple practice or guidance.
    *   Using a dictionary to check spelling (mentioned in aims, Activity 8 is a spelling bee but not dictionary skills).

3.  **Grammar and Vocabulary - Further Concepts:**
    *   Choosing nouns or pronouns appropriately for clarity and cohesion and to avoid repetition.
    *   More explicit practice with a wider variety of adverbs and prepositions beyond just time/cause.

4.  **Spoken Language - More Direct (if feasible) or Varied Integration:**
    *   While integration is good, perhaps a simple activity focusing on *giving well-structured descriptions, explanations, or narratives orally* (perhaps with DALA providing a visual prompt and the student records themselves, even if not auto-analyzed).
    *   Activities that more directly encourage *participating in discussions or debates* through structured prompts within DALA, even if the actual discussion is offline.

**Focus for New 5-7 Activities:**

Given the need for 5-7 *new* activities, I will prioritize creating activities that address the identified gaps, particularly:
*   Non-fiction reading comprehension (main ideas, structure, recording info).
*   Writing different non-narrative text types.
*   Specific editing and proofreading skills.
*   Dictionary skills.
*   Expanding on grammar concepts like pronouns and varied adverbials/prepositions.
*   Potentially one more focused, albeit simple, spoken language activity or a more diverse integration approach.

This analysis will guide the creation of the new learning activities in the next step of the plan.
