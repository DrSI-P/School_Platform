# EdPsych Connect: Curriculum Expansion Plan

## New Curriculum Slice: Key Stage 2 English (Years 3 and 4)

This document outlines the expansion of the EdPsych Connect curriculum to include a new slice focusing on **Key Stage 2 (KS2) English, specifically for Years 3 and 4** (typically ages 7-9). This expansion aligns with the UK National Curriculum and aims to provide engaging, evidence-based learning activities to support students in developing their reading, writing, and spoken language skills.

### General Aims for KS2 English (Years 3 and 4)

Based on the National Curriculum for England, the general aims for English during Years 3 and 4 are to ensure that all pupils:

*   **Reading:**
    *   Develop an appreciation and love of reading, and read increasingly challenging material independently.
    *   Understand what they read, in books they can read independently, by checking that the text makes sense to them, discussing their understanding, and explaining the meaning of words in context.
    *   Draw inferences such as inferring characters’ feelings, thoughts and motives from their actions, and justifying inferences with evidence.
    *   Predict what might happen from details stated and implied.
    *   Identify main ideas drawn from more than one paragraph and summarise these.
    *   Identify how language, structure, and presentation contribute to meaning.
    *   Retrieve and record information from non-fiction.
    *   Apply their growing knowledge of root words, prefixes and suffixes (etymology and morphology), as listed in English Appendix 1, both to read aloud and to understand the meaning of new words they meet.
*   **Writing:**
    *   Plan their writing by discussing writing similar to that which they are planning to write in order to understand and learn from its structure, vocabulary and grammar, and by discussing and recording ideas.
    *   Draft and write by composing and rehearsing sentences orally (including dialogue), progressively building a varied and rich vocabulary and an increasing range of sentence structures (English Appendix 2).
    *   Organise paragraphs around a theme.
    *   In narratives, create settings, characters and plot.
    *   In non-narrative material, use simple organisational devices [for example, headings and sub-headings].
    *   Evaluate and edit by assessing the effectiveness of their own and others’ writing and suggesting improvements, and by proposing changes to grammar and vocabulary to improve consistency, including the accurate use of pronouns in sentences.
    *   Proof-read for spelling and punctuation errors.
    *   Use further prefixes and suffixes and understand how to add them (English Appendix 1).
    *   Spell further homophones and words that are often misspelt (English Appendix 1).
    *   Place the possessive apostrophe accurately in words with regular plurals [for example, girls’, boys’] and in words with irregular plurals [for example, children’s].
    *   Use the first two or three letters of a word to check its spelling in a dictionary.
    *   Write from memory simple sentences, dictated by the teacher, that include words and punctuation taught so far.
    *   Increase the legibility, consistency and quality of their handwriting.
*   **Grammar and Vocabulary:**
    *   Develop their understanding of the concepts set out in English Appendix 2.
    *   Extend the range of sentences with more than one clause by using a wider range of conjunctions, including when, if, because, although.
    *   Use the present perfect form of verbs in contrast to the past tense.
    *   Choose nouns or pronouns appropriately for clarity and cohesion and to avoid repetition.
    *   Use conjunctions, adverbs and prepositions to express time and cause.
    *   Use fronted adverbials and use commas after fronted adverbials.
    *   Indicate possession by using the possessive apostrophe with plural nouns.
    *   Use and punctuate direct speech.
*   **Spoken Language:**
    *   Listen and respond appropriately to adults and their peers.
    *   Ask relevant questions to extend their understanding and knowledge.
    *   Use relevant strategies to build their vocabulary.
    *   Articulate and justify answers, arguments and opinions.
    *   Give well-structured descriptions, explanations and narratives for different purposes, including for expressing feelings.
    *   Maintain attention and participate actively in collaborative conversations, staying on topic and initiating and responding to comments.
    *   Use spoken language to develop understanding through speculating, hypothesising, imagining and exploring ideas.
    *   Speak audibly and fluently with an increasing command of Standard English.
    *   Participate in discussions, presentations, performances, role play, improvisations and debates.
    *   Gain, maintain and monitor the interest of the listener(s).
    *   Consider and evaluate different viewpoints, attending to and building on the contributions of others.
    *   Select and use appropriate registers for effective communication.

Below are the proposed learning activities designed to meet these aims.

## Proposed Learning Activities for KS2 English (Years 3-4)

This section outlines proposed learning activities for the new Key Stage 2 English curriculum slice, focusing on Years 3 and 4. These activities are designed to be engaging and align with the UK National Curriculum requirements.

## I. Reading Comprehension

### LO: Understand what they read, in books they can read independently, by:
*   drawing inferences such as inferring characters’ feelings, thoughts and motives from their actions, and justifying inferences with evidence
*   predicting what might happen from details stated and implied

**Activity 1: Character Detective**
*   **Description:** Students read short story excerpts or chapters from an age-appropriate book. After reading, they are presented with a "Case File" for a specific character. The case file asks questions like: "How do you think [Character Name] was feeling when...? What clues in the story tell you this?" or "What might [Character Name] do next? Why do you think so?".
*   **Format:** Interactive quiz/worksheet within the DALA interface. Students type their answers, and for justification, they might be asked to highlight or copy relevant sentences from the text.
*   **Engagement:** Theming it as a detective activity can make it more engaging. Points or badges could be awarded for well-justified inferences.

**Activity 2: Prediction Portal**
*   **Description:** Students read a story up to a cliffhanger moment. The "Prediction Portal" then opens, asking them to write or choose (from multiple choice options) what they think will happen next and why. After submitting their prediction, they read the rest of the story to see if they were right.
*   **Format:** Interactive story module. Could include visual elements to represent the "portal".
*   **Engagement:** The element of suspense and seeing if their predictions come true can be highly motivating.

## II. Writing - Composition

### LO: Plan their writing by:
*   discussing writing similar to that which they are planning to write in order to understand and learn from its structure, vocabulary and grammar
*   discussing and recording ideas

**Activity 3: Story Deconstruction & Idea Generation**
*   **Description:** Students are shown an example of a short narrative (e.g., a fable or a simple adventure story). The DALA interface guides them through deconstructing it: identifying the beginning, middle, and end; key characters; the problem and solution; and interesting vocabulary or sentence structures. Afterwards, they are prompted to brainstorm ideas for their own story based on a similar theme or a new prompt, using a mind map or a structured notes template.
*   **Format:** Interactive module with text analysis tools (e.g., highlighting, annotation) and idea generation templates.
*   **Engagement:** Making it a collaborative or guided process. Perhaps DALA can offer suggestions or prompts during the idea generation phase.

### LO: Draft and write by:
*   composing and rehearsing sentences orally (including dialogue), progressively building a varied and rich vocabulary and an increasing range of sentence structures (English Appendix 2)
*   organising paragraphs around a theme
*   in narratives, creating settings, characters and plot

**Activity 4: Sentence Builder & Story Weaver**
*   **Description:** This activity could have two parts.
    *   **Sentence Builder:** Students are given prompts or a set of keywords and are encouraged to build interesting sentences. This could involve a drag-and-drop interface for sentence parts or a fill-in-the-blanks exercise focusing on varied sentence structures and vocabulary. Voice input could be used for rehearsing sentences orally.
    *   **Story Weaver:** Based on their plan from Activity 3, students begin drafting their story, paragraph by paragraph. DALA could provide prompts for each paragraph (e.g., "Now describe your main character.", "What problem do they face?").
*   **Format:** Interactive writing tool with prompts, vocabulary suggestions, and potentially a simple paragraph organization interface.
*   **Engagement:** Awarding points for using new vocabulary or complex sentences. Visual progress indicators as they build their story.

## III. Writing - Vocabulary, Grammar and Punctuation

### LO: Develop their understanding of the concepts set out in English Appendix 2 by:
*   extending the range of sentences with more than one clause by using a wider range of conjunctions, including when, if, because, although
*   using the present perfect form of verbs in contrast to the past tense
*   using conjunctions, adverbs and prepositions to express time and cause

**Activity 5: Conjunction Connection & Tense Traveller**
*   **Description:**
    *   **Conjunction Connection:** Students are given pairs of simple sentences and a list of conjunctions (when, if, because, although, etc.). They need to choose the correct conjunction to connect the sentences meaningfully. Could also involve rewriting sentences to include these conjunctions.
    *   **Tense Traveller:** Students are presented with sentences in the past tense and need to rewrite them in the present perfect tense, or vice-versa. Short scenarios could be provided where they need to choose the correct tense to describe an action.
*   **Format:** Interactive exercises – drag and drop, fill-in-the-blanks, sentence rewriting.
*   **Engagement:** Gamified elements like a "Conjunction Collector" game or a "Time Machine" theme for tenses. Points for correct answers and speed.

### LO: Indicate grammatical and other features by:
*   using commas after fronted adverbials
*   indicating possession by using the possessive apostrophe with plural nouns
*   using and punctuating direct speech

**Activity 6: Punctuation Power-Up**
*   **Description:**
    *   **Fronted Adverbial Fix-up:** Students are shown sentences with fronted adverbials missing commas and have to add them in the correct place.
    *   **Apostrophe Ace:** Exercises focusing on forming possessive plurals (e.g., "the dogs_ food", "the childrens_ toys").
    *   **Direct Speech Director:** Students are given sentences and need to rewrite them using correct direct speech punctuation (speech marks, commas, etc.). They could also be given a short comic strip and asked to write the dialogue with correct punctuation.
*   **Format:** Interactive punctuation exercises. Could involve highlighting where punctuation should go, or typing it in.
*   **Engagement:** A "Punctuation Hero" theme where students earn points/stars for correctly punctuating sentences. Mini-games could involve quickly identifying missing punctuation.

## IV. Reading - Word Reading & Spelling (Integrated)

### LO: Apply their growing knowledge of root words, prefixes and suffixes (etymology and morphology) as listed in English Appendix 1, both to read aloud and to understand the meaning of new words they meet.
### LO: Use further prefixes and suffixes and understand how to add them (English Appendix 1).

**Activity 7: Word Builder Challenge**
*   **Description:** Students are given root words and a selection of prefixes and suffixes. They need to combine them to create new words and then define those words or use them in a sentence. This can also work in reverse: students are given a word with a prefix/suffix and need to identify the root word and the meaning added by the affix.
*   **Format:** Drag-and-drop interface, fill-in-the-blanks, or multiple-choice questions.
*   **Engagement:** A timed challenge or a game where students "build" as many correct words as possible. Visuals of building blocks could be used.

### LO: Spell further homophones.
### LO: Spell words that are often misspelt (English Appendix 1).

**Activity 8: Homophone Maze & Spelling Bee Bonanza**
*   **Description:**
    *   **Homophone Maze:** Students navigate a maze by choosing the correct homophone to complete a sentence at each junction (e.g., "The [bear/bare] tree stood in the field.").
    *   **Spelling Bee Bonanza:** A series of spelling tests focusing on commonly misspelt words from Appendix 1 and other age-appropriate vocabulary. Could include audio prompts for the words.
*   **Format:** Interactive maze game; spelling test module with text input and automated marking.
*   **Engagement:** The maze provides a fun, game-like context. The spelling bee could have levels of difficulty and award virtual trophies or badges.

## V. Spoken Language (Integrated where appropriate)

### LO: Listen and respond appropriately to adults and their peers.
### LO: Ask relevant questions to extend their understanding and knowledge.
### LO: Articulate and justify answers, arguments and opinions.
### LO: Participate in discussions, presentations, performances, role play, improvisations and debates.

**General Approach for Spoken Language:**
While harder to directly implement as standalone DALA activities without advanced AI speech analysis, these LOs can be encouraged *through* other activities:
*   **Discussion Prompts:** After completing a reading comprehension or writing task, DALA can provide prompts for the student to discuss their work or ideas with a parent, teacher, or peer (e.g., "Explain to someone why you think the character felt sad.", "Read your story aloud to a friend and ask for their favourite part.").
*   **Role-Play Ideas:** Suggest role-play scenarios related to stories read or written (e.g., "Imagine you are interviewing the main character. What three questions would you ask?").
*   **Presentation Preparation:** For writing tasks, DALA could include a small section on "Presenting Your Work," with tips on speaking clearly and making eye contact, encouraging them to share their written pieces orally.
*   **Voice Input Integration:** As seen in Activity 4 (Sentence Builder), allowing voice input for drafting or rehearsing sentences supports oral language development.

**Note on Activity Design:**
*   All activities should provide clear instructions and examples.
*   Feedback should be constructive and immediate where possible.
*   A variety of question types and interaction methods should be used to maintain engagement.
*   Visual appeal and age-appropriateness are key.
*   Links to the "Adventure Quest Saga" theme can be woven in where suitable (e.g., character names, settings, quest-like challenges).
