# Educator Dashboard Outline - EdPsych Connect DALA

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the conceptual design for a future Educator Dashboard within the EdPsych Connect DALA platform. The dashboard aims to provide educators with actionable insights into student learning, progress, and engagement, thereby supporting differentiated instruction and reducing administrative burden.

## 2. Goals of the Educator Dashboard

*   **Provide a clear overview** of class and individual student progress.
*   **Identify students** who may need additional support or challenge.
*   **Offer insights** into learning patterns and common areas of difficulty.
*   **Facilitate efficient monitoring** of student engagement with learning materials.
*   **Support data-informed decision-making** for instructional planning.
*   **Reduce administrative tasks** related to progress tracking and reporting.

## 3. Key Sections and Features (Conceptual)

### 3.1. Dashboard Home / Overview
*   **At-a-Glance Metrics:**
    *   Number of active students.
    *   Overall class progress (e.g., average LOs completed).
    *   Number of students requiring attention (e.g., falling behind, disengaged).
    *   Recently completed milestones or achievements by students.
*   **Alerts & Notifications:**
    *   Students significantly deviating from expected progress.
    *   New HLP insights or significant changes in learner profiles.
    *   System updates or new content availability.
*   **Quick Links:**
    *   Navigate to student lists, curriculum overview, reporting.

### 3.2. Student Management & Profiles
*   **Student Roster:**
    *   Searchable and sortable list of all students assigned to the educator.
    *   Key info: Name, Year Group, Last Active, Overall Progress.
*   **Individual Student Deep Dive (links from Roster):
    *   **Learner Profile Summary:** Key HLP insights (learning preferences, interests, struggle areas, goals).
    *   **Detailed Progress:** Breakdown of completed LOs, current LO, time spent, performance on activities/assessments.
    *   **Pathway History:** View past and current learning pathways assigned.
    *   **Badges & Achievements:** View earned badges.
    *   **Notes & Observations:** Section for educators to add private notes about a student.
*   **Group Management (Future):**
    *   Ability to create and manage custom student groups for targeted instruction.

### 3.3. Class & Curriculum Progress
*   **Curriculum View:**
    *   Overview of all curriculum slices and Learning Objectives (LOs) relevant to the class/year group.
    *   Class-level completion rates for each LO.
    *   Drill-down to see which students have completed/not started/are struggling with specific LOs.
*   **Learning Gap Analysis:**
    *   Visualizations highlighting common LOs where students are struggling.
    *   Identification of prerequisite LOs that might be causing downstream difficulties.
*   **Activity & Content Engagement:**
    *   Analytics on which learning activities are most/least used.
    *   (Future) Correlation of activity usage with LO mastery.

### 3.4. Assessment & Feedback Insights (Future - dependent on assessment features)
*   **Assessment Overview:**
    *   Summary of performance on any platform-based assessments.
    *   Distribution of scores/outcomes.
*   **Automated Feedback Review:**
    *   If AI provides feedback, a way for educators to review and potentially override/supplement.

### 3.5. Reporting & Analytics
*   **Standard Reports:**
    *   Individual student progress reports (printable/exportable).
    *   Class progress summaries.
    *   Engagement reports.
*   **Customizable Reporting (Future):**
    *   Ability to filter and generate reports based on specific criteria.

### 3.6. Communication Tools (Conceptual - Future)
*   **Secure Messaging:**
    *   Internal messaging with students (if appropriate for age group and school policy).
    *   Communication channel with parents/guardians (if platform supports parent accounts).

### 3.7. Educator Account & Settings
*   **Profile Management.**
*   **Notification Preferences.**
*   **Dashboard Customization (e.g., widgets to display on home).**

## 4. Data Points to Display (Examples)

*   Student Name, ID, Year Group
*   Learning Objective (ID, Description, Subject)
*   Content Item (ID, Title, Type, Difficulty)
*   Progress Status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Needs Review)
*   Completion Dates, Time Spent on Task/Activity
*   Assessment Scores, Badge Earned Dates
*   HLP Data (Preferences, Interests, Struggles, Goals)

## 5. Design Considerations

*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive navigation, clear visualizations.
*   **Actionable Insights:** Data should be presented in a way that directly informs teaching practices.
*   **Data Privacy & Security:** Adherence to all relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).
*   **Responsive Design:** Accessible on various devices (desktops, tablets).
*   **Minimal Clutter:** Focus on presenting the most important information effectively.

## 6. Future Iterations

*   Integration with AI Co-Planner for differentiated instruction suggestions.
*   Tools for educators to assign specific LOs or content.
*   More advanced analytics and predictive insights (e.g., students at risk of falling behind).

This outline serves as a starting point for discussion and further refinement of the Educator Dashboard.
