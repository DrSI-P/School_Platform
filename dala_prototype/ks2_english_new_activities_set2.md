# New Learning Activities for KS2 English (Years 3-4) - Set 2

This document outlines 5-7 new learning activities for the Key Stage 2 English curriculum slice (Years 3 and 4), building upon the initial set and addressing identified gaps. These activities are designed to be engaging and align with the UK National Curriculum requirements.

## VI. Reading Comprehension - Non-Fiction Focus

### LO: Identify main ideas drawn from more than one paragraph and summarise these.
### LO: Retrieve and record information from non-fiction.
### LO: Identify how language, structure, and presentation contribute to meaning (focus on non-fiction).

**Activity 9: Non-Fiction Navigator**
*   **Description:** Students are presented with an age-appropriate non-fiction text (e.g., about an animal, a historical event, or a simple scientific concept). The text will be broken into 2-3 short sections or paragraphs.
    *   **Part 1 (Main Ideas):** After reading each section, students identify the main idea of that section from multiple-choice options or by writing a short sentence.
    *   **Part 2 (Summarising):** After reading the whole text, students are asked to write a short summary (1-2 sentences) of the entire text, combining the main ideas.
    *   **Part 3 (Information Retrieval):** Students answer specific questions that require them to find and record information from the text (e.g., "What does a [animal] eat?", "When did [event] happen?").
    *   **Part 4 (Text Features):** Questions will prompt students to identify and explain the purpose of non-fiction text features used (e.g., headings, subheadings, bold text, simple diagrams/labels if present). "How does the heading help you understand what this section is about?"
*   **Format:** Interactive module with the non-fiction text displayed. Multiple-choice questions, short text input fields for summaries and retrieved information. May include highlighting tools to identify where information was found.
*   **Engagement:** Theming could be around exploration or research (e.g., "Become a Fact Finder!"). Points awarded for correct main idea identification, accurate summaries, and correct information retrieval. Visuals related to the non-fiction topic.

## VII. Writing - Non-Narrative & Evaluation

### LO: In non-narrative material, use simple organisational devices [for example, headings and sub-headings].
### LO: Write for different purposes (e.g., to instruct, to explain).

**Activity 10: How-To Guide Creator**
*   **Description:** Students are tasked with writing a set of instructions for a simple activity (e.g., "How to Make a Paper Aeroplane," "How to Plant a Seed," "How to Play Your Favourite Simple Game").
    *   **Planning:** DALA provides a simple template prompting for a title, a list of materials/what’s needed, and then numbered steps.
    *   **Drafting:** Students write the instructions, focusing on clear, imperative verbs and sequential order. DALA could offer prompts for using time connectives (First, Next, Then, Finally).
    *   **Organisational Devices:** Students will be prompted to add a main title (heading) and potentially sub-headings if the instructions are more complex (e.g., "Materials Needed," "Steps").
*   **Format:** Interactive writing tool with a structured template. Vocabulary banks for imperative verbs and time connectives could be provided.
*   **Engagement:** Students could choose from a few topics or suggest their own simple task. The idea of creating something useful for others can be motivating. They could even (offline) test their instructions.

### LO: Evaluate and edit by assessing the effectiveness of their own and others’ writing and suggesting improvements.
### LO: Proof-read for spelling and punctuation errors.

**Activity 11: Editor's Desk**
*   **Description:** Students are presented with short pieces of writing (narrative or non-narrative, purportedly written by another student or a DALA character) that contain common errors for the age group. These errors could include:
    *   Spelling mistakes (from common misspelt word lists).
    *   Punctuation errors (missing full stops, capital letters, incorrect use of commas, missing speech marks).
    *   Simple grammatical errors (e.g., subject-verb agreement, incorrect tense usage).
    *   Areas where clarity could be improved (e.g., repetitive sentence starts, unclear pronoun references).
    Students need to identify the errors and suggest corrections. For clarity issues, they might be asked to rewrite a sentence to make it better.
*   **Format:** Interactive text editing tool. Students might click on errors and choose a correction, or type corrections directly. Separate sections for proofreading (spelling/punctuation) and editing (clarity/effectiveness).
*   **Engagement:** Theming as an "Editor" or "Proofreading Pro." Points for each correctly identified and corrected error. Could have different levels of difficulty with more subtle errors in higher levels.

## VIII. Vocabulary & Dictionary Skills

### LO: Use the first two or three letters of a word to check its spelling in a dictionary.

**Activity 12: Dictionary Detective Dash**
*   **Description:** Students are given a list of 5-7 words, some of which might be slightly challenging to spell or unfamiliar. They are then presented with a simplified, on-screen DALA dictionary interface (or guided to use a physical one if preferred for blended learning).
    *   **Task 1 (Finding Words):** For each word, they need to identify which guide words on a dictionary page it would fall between (e.g., "If the guide words are 'cat' and 'cot', would 'chatter' be on this page?").
    *   **Task 2 (Checking Spelling):** Some words in the list might be deliberately misspelt. Students use the dictionary (or their knowledge of how to use one) to confirm the correct spelling.
    *   **Task 3 (Simple Definitions - Optional Extension):** For a couple of the words, they could be asked to find and write down a simple definition.
*   **Format:** Interactive module. Could simulate dictionary pages or guide words. Multiple choice for guide word questions, text input for corrected spellings/definitions.
*   **Engagement:** A timed challenge or a race against a DALA character. Points for speed and accuracy in locating words or identifying correct spellings.

## IX. Grammar & Punctuation - Expansion

### LO: Choose nouns or pronouns appropriately for clarity and cohesion and to avoid repetition.
### LO: Use conjunctions, adverbs and prepositions to express time and cause (expanding on variety).

**Activity 13: Pronoun Power & Adverbial Adventures**
*   **Description:**
    *   **Part 1 (Pronoun Power):** Students are given short paragraphs where nouns are overused (e.g., "Tom went to the park. Tom saw a dog. Tom threw the ball for the dog."). They need to rewrite the sentences using appropriate pronouns to improve flow and avoid repetition.
    *   **Part 2 (Adverbial Adventures):** Students are given sentences and a bank of more varied adverbs and prepositions (beyond basic time/cause, e.g., adverbs of manner, prepositions of place/direction). They need to choose suitable adverbs/prepositions to complete or enhance the sentences. Could also involve identifying the type of adverb/preposition used.
*   **Format:** Interactive sentence rewriting exercises. Drag-and-drop or fill-in-the-blanks for adverbial/preposition selection.
*   **Engagement:** Theming around making writing more interesting or professional. "Super Writer Sentences!" Points for correct pronoun usage and effective choice of adverbs/prepositions.

This set provides 5 new distinct activities (9-13). These cover non-fiction comprehension, non-narrative writing, editing/proofreading, dictionary skills, and expanded grammar concepts, addressing the key gaps identified.
