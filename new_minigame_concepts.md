# New Reward Mini-Game Concepts for DALA

This document outlines potential ideas for a new reward mini-game to be integrated into the EdPsych Connect DALA platform, complementing the existing "Star Collector" and aligning with the "Adventure Quest Saga" theme.

## Guiding Principles for Mini-Game Design:

*   **Engagement:** The game should be fun and motivating for a wide age range (Nursery to Secondary).
*   **Educational Value:** While primarily a reward, the game should ideally reinforce positive learning habits or simple cognitive skills (e.g., quick thinking, pattern recognition, problem-solving, memory).
*   **Thematic Alignment:** Concepts should ideally fit within the "Adventure Quest Saga" fantasy/exploration theme.
*   **Simplicity:** The game should be easy to understand and play, with minimal instructions.
*   **Accessibility:** Design should consider basic accessibility, avoiding overly complex controls or visuals that might be problematic.
*   **Brevity:** Mini-games should be short, providing a quick, satisfying break.

## Brainstormed Mini-Game Concepts:

1.  **Crystal Collector / Gem Sorter:** A fast-paced sorting game where players collect falling crystals or sort them into different categories based on color or shape. Could tie into "Numeria" (Math - shapes, sorting) or "Whispering Wilds" (Science - crystal types).
2.  **Ancient Rune Match:** A memory game where players flip tiles to find matching pairs of ancient runes or symbols. Could be themed around deciphering clues for the Adventure Quest.
3.  **Pathfinder Puzzle:** A simple maze or path-drawing game where the player guides their avatar or a friendly creature through a small, procedurally generated labyrinth to reach a treasure or goal. Reinforces spatial reasoning.
4.  **Potion Brewing Assistant:** A quick reaction game where ingredients for a potion drop down, and the player has to tap the correct ones according_to a recipe scroll. Could be themed around a magical laboratory.
5.  **Dragon Egg Hatch:** A simple clicker/nurturing game where the player earns a dragon egg and periodically clicks to keep it warm/happy until it hatches, revealing a small, cute dragon visual. Less skill-based, more of a persistent small reward.

## Detailed Concept 1: "Rune Weaver" (Ancient Rune Match)

*   **Core Mechanic:** Memory matching (Concentration/Pairs game).
*   **Objective:** Find all matching pairs of ancient runes on a grid of face-down tiles within a time limit or a set number of attempts.
*   **Educational Reinforcement:** Memory, pattern recognition, focus.
*   **Thematic Alignment:** Fits the "Adventure Quest Saga" by theming the runes as ancient symbols, keys to unlocking map segments, or messages from a wise old sage. The visual style could be stone tablets, glowing runes, etc.
*   **Gameplay:**
    *   A grid of tiles (e.g., 4x3, 4x4, 5x4, difficulty can scale with grid size) is presented, face down.
    *   Player clicks two tiles to reveal the runes on them.
    *   If the runes match, the tiles stay face up (or are removed/collected), and the player scores points.
    *   If they don't match, the tiles flip back face down after a short delay.
    *   The game ends when all pairs are found or the time/attempts run out.
*   **Visuals/Sound:**
    *   Tiles could look like stone slabs, wooden tokens, or magical scrolls.
    *   Runes should be distinct and visually interesting, perhaps with a slight glow.
    *   Sound effects for tile flips, matches, and mismatches (e.g., a chime for a match, a dull thud for a mismatch).
    *   Background could be an ancient library, a cave wall, or a mystical clearing.
*   **Variations/Progression:** 
    *   Increasing grid size for higher difficulty.
    *   Introducing a time limit or a limit on the number of incorrect matches.
    *   Bonus points for quick matches or streaks.
    *   Unlockable new rune sets or backgrounds as the student progresses in their main learning journey.

## Detailed Concept 2: "Crystal Path" (Pathfinder Puzzle)

*   **Core Mechanic:** Maze navigation / Path drawing.
*   **Objective:** Guide the student's avatar (or a friendly creature like a baby griffin) from a starting point to a treasure chest or a glowing crystal at the end of a small maze.
*   **Educational Reinforcement:** Spatial reasoning, planning, problem-solving (simple).
*   **Thematic Alignment:** Directly ties into exploration and questing. The maze could be a cave, a forest path, or ancient ruins. The reward could be a "map fragment" or a "power crystal" for the Adventure Quest.
*   **Gameplay:**
    *   A small, top-down view of a maze is presented.
    *   The player can either click/tap on adjacent open squares to move the avatar, or draw a path from start to finish which the avatar then follows.
    *   The maze could have collectable bonus items (e.g., small gems) along the way for extra points.
    *   A simple timer could add a light challenge, or it could be untimed for a more relaxed experience.
*   **Visuals/Sound:**
    *   Maze walls could be stone, hedges, or crystal formations.
    *   Avatar could be the student's existing avatar or a small, cute creature.
    *   Treasure chest or goal crystal should be visually appealing.
    *   Sound effects for movement, collecting items, and reaching the goal.
    *   Gentle, adventurous background music.
*   **Variations/Progression:**
    *   Mazes can become slightly more complex as the student plays more.
    *   Introduction of simple, avoidable obstacles (e.g., a sleeping monster that wakes if touched, a patch of sticky mud that slows movement).
    *   Different visual themes for mazes based on the Adventure Quest Saga regions.

## Recommendation:

Both "Rune Weaver" and "Crystal Path" offer good thematic fit and simple, engaging mechanics with subtle cognitive benefits. "Rune Weaver" focuses on memory, while "Crystal Path" focuses on spatial reasoning. 

Given the existing "Star Collector" is a reaction-based game, a memory or puzzle game would offer more variety. **"Rune Weaver"** might be slightly easier to implement initially with a fixed set of runes and grid sizes, and offers clear paths for scaling difficulty.

I will await feedback before proceeding with a more detailed design for one of these, or exploring other options if preferred.
