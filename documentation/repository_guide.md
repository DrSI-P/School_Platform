# Repository Integration Guide for EdPsych Connect

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for integrating the EdPsych Connect platform with GitHub repositories, ensuring consistent code management, version control, and collaboration. It covers repository structure, branching strategy, code review process, and integration with CI/CD pipelines.

## Repository Structure

### Main Repositories

1. **EdPsychConnect-Core**
   - Core platform functionality
   - Backend API services
   - Database models and migrations
   - Shared utilities and libraries

2. **EdPsychConnect-Frontend**
   - Next.js frontend application
   - React components
   - State management
   - UI/UX assets

3. **EdPsychConnect-Documentation**
   - Technical documentation
   - API documentation
   - User guides
   - Architecture diagrams

### Repository Organization

Each repository should follow this structure:

```
├── .github/
│   ├── workflows/       # GitHub Actions workflows
│   ├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/  # Issue templates
│   └── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
├── src/                 # Source code
├── tests/               # Test files
├── docs/                # Documentation
├── scripts/             # Utility scripts
├── .gitignore           # Git ignore file
├── README.md            # Repository overview
└── LICENSE              # License information
```

## Branching Strategy

We will implement a Git Flow branching strategy:

1. **main**: Production-ready code
2. **develop**: Integration branch for features
3. **feature/**: Feature development branches
4. **release/**: Release preparation branches
5. **hotfix/**: Emergency fixes for production

### Branch Naming Conventions

- Feature branches: `feature/feature-name`
- Release branches: `release/vX.Y.Z`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/issue-description`

## Code Review Process

1. **Pull Request Creation**
   - Create PR from feature branch to develop
   - Fill out PR template with description, changes, and testing details
   - Assign reviewers

2. **Review Requirements**
   - At least one approval required
   - All automated checks must pass
   - No unresolved comments

3. **Merge Process**
   - Squash and merge to keep history clean
   - Delete feature branch after merge
   - Update related issues

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflows

1. **Build and Test**
   - Triggered on push to any branch
   - Runs unit and integration tests
   - Performs code quality checks
   - Generates test coverage reports

2. **Security Scan**
   - Scans for vulnerabilities
   - Checks for dependency issues
   - Performs static code analysis

3. **Deployment**
   - Deploys to development environment from develop branch
   - Deploys to staging from release branches
   - Deploys to production from main branch

## Version Control Best Practices

1. **Commit Messages**
   - Follow conventional commits format
   - Include issue number when applicable
   - Be descriptive but concise

2. **Code Organization**
   - Keep commits focused on single changes
   - Avoid mixing unrelated changes
   - Commit early and often during development

3. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation with code changes
   - Document API changes in OpenAPI format
   - Keep README files current

## Repository Integration with School_Platform

To align with the existing School_Platform repository:

1. **Code Structure Alignment**
   - Match folder structure where appropriate
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Align with existing patterns

2. **Authentication Integration**
   - Use compatible authentication mechanisms
   - Share JWT secret management
   - Align user role definitions

3. **Database Strategy**
   - Use consistent database naming conventions
   - Align foreign key relationships
   - Document shared tables and fields

## Integration with Ai-Educational-Platform

To incorporate valuable features from the Ai-Educational-Platform:

1. **Feature Identification**
   - Identify AI features for integration
   - Document dependencies and requirements
   - Plan migration strategy

2. **Code Migration**
   - Extract relevant components
   - Adapt to EdPsych Connect architecture
   - Update dependencies and imports

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Create tests for migrated features
   - Verify functionality matches original
   - Document any behavioral changes

## GitHub Repository Setup

1. **Repository Creation**
   - Create repositories under organization account
   - Set up branch protection rules
   - Configure access permissions

2. **Initial Setup**
   - Initialize with README, LICENSE, and .gitignore
   - Set up issue labels and milestones
   - Configure project boards

3. **Collaboration Configuration**
   - Set up team access
   - Configure notification settings
   - Set up required status checks

## Documentation Management

1. **Code Documentation**
   - Use JSDoc for JavaScript/TypeScript
   - Use docstrings for Python
   - Generate API documentation automatically

2. **Repository Documentation**
   - Maintain comprehensive README files
   - Include setup and contribution guides
   - Document architecture decisions

3. **User Documentation**
   - Store user guides in Documentation repository
   - Use Markdown for easy viewing on GitHub
   - Include screenshots and examples

## Release Management

1. **Versioning**
   - Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
   - Tag releases in Git
   - Generate changelogs automatically

2. **Release Process**
   - Create release branch from develop
   - Perform final testing
   - Merge to main and tag
   - Deploy to production

3. **Hotfix Process**
   - Create hotfix branch from main
   - Apply and test fix
   - Merge to main and develop
   - Deploy to production

## Next Steps

1. Create GitHub organization for EdPsych Connect
2. Set up core repositories with initial structure
3. Configure branch protection and access controls
4. Migrate existing code to new repositories
5. Set up CI/CD pipelines
6. Document contribution guidelines
7. Train team on Git workflow
