- Create high-contrast mode
- Implement text size adjustment
- Add dyslexia-friendly font options
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### 3. Visual Design Improvements
- Align with EdPsych Connect branding
- Create more engaging, animated interactions
- Implement gamification elements
- Add progress indicators and rewards
- Enhance visual feedback for actions

### 4. Integration with EdPsych Connect
- Unify authentication with main platform
- Connect pupil voice data with student profiles
- Integrate with SENCo module for EHCP evidence
- Link with Teacher-TA collaboration tools
- Connect with parent communication portal
