## Integration with Backend

The frontend will integrate with the backend through RESTful API endpoints. Each component will connect to its corresponding backend service:

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
2. **Student Data**: Student profiles, progress, and notes
3. **Assessment Tools**: Assessment creation, management, and analytics
4. **Messaging**: Secure communication with parents and professionals
5. **Resource Library**: Resource management and recommendation
6. **Collaboration Tools**: Teacher-TA planning and coordination
7. **Analytics**: Learning gaps and engagement visualization
8. **Reporting**: Student and class report generation

## Deployment Strategy

The frontend will be deployed using a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline:

1. **Development Environment**: For ongoing development and testing
2. **Staging Environment**: For pre-release testing and validation
3. **Production Environment**: For end-user access

The application will be deployed to a cloud hosting provider with CDN integration for optimal performance and availability.

## Next Steps

1. Initialize the Next.js project with the defined structure
2. Implement the authentication system
3. Create the core dashboard layout and navigation
4. Begin implementing the student management views
5. Progressively add feature-specific interfaces
