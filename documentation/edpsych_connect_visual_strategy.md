Based on our comprehensive competitive analysis, this document outlines a prioritized visual enhancement strategy to position EdPsych Connect as the most visually appealing and engaging educational platform in the market. The strategy focuses on creating a distinctive, vibrant visual identity that reinforces the platform's educational psychology foundation while ensuring accessibility and engagement across all user groups.

## Strategic Priorities

### Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate Implementation)

1. **Color System Redesign**

     - Primary sans-serif font for headings (e.g., Nunito or Quicksand) that conveys friendliness and professionalism
     - Secondary serif font for longer content that improves readability
     - Dyslexia-friendly font option (e.g., OpenDyslexic) as user preference
     - Consistent type scale with clear hierarchy across all platform elements
