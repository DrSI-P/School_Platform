# DALA Stage 1 Prototype Documentation

## 1. Overview

This document provides an overview of the Stage 1 prototype for the Dynamic AI Learning Architect (DALA). The DALA prototype aims to demonstrate the core functionalities of a personalized learning system, including learner profiling, curriculum management, adaptive pathway generation, and an engaging student interface. This initial stage focuses on establishing the foundational components and showcasing a simplified end-to-end user experience.

The prototype is developed as part of the EdPsych Connect platform, with the vision of creating a deeply personalized, engaging, and supportive learning environment for students, while also reducing administrative burdens for educators.

Key achievements in Stage 1 include:
- Development of a basic Holistic Learner Profiling (HLP) module.
- Digitization of a small curriculum slice.
- Implementation of initial logic for Dynamic Curriculum Weaving & Adaptive Pathway Generation (DCW-APG).
- Creation of a dynamic, gamified student interface prototype.

## 2. Components

The DALA Stage 1 prototype consists of several interconnected Python modules and an HTML interface.

### 2.1. Holistic Learner Profiling (HLP) Module
- **File:** `hlp_module.py`
- **Purpose:** To gather initial information about the student's learning preferences, interests, and areas where they feel they need support. This forms the basis of their learner profile.
- **Key Functions/Features:**
    - `LearnerProfile` class: Stores student ID, learning preferences (e.g., visual, textual), selected interests, and identified struggle areas.
    - Simulated interactive mini-tasks: Simple prompts to determine initial learning style preferences (e.g., choosing between a game or a story for learning).
    - Interest selection: Allows students to pick from a predefined list of interests.
    - Struggle area identification: A section for students to indicate topics or skills they find challenging.
- **Data Structures:** The `LearnerProfile` object encapsulates all collected student data.

### 2.2. Curriculum & Content Module
- **File:** `curriculum_content_module.py`
- **Purpose:** To store and manage the digitized learning content. For Stage 1, this includes a small slice of the UK curriculum (Year 4 Maths - Multiplication & Division).
- **Key Functions/Features:**
    - `ContentStore` class: Manages a collection of learning objectives and associated learning activities.
    - `LearningObjective` class: Represents a specific learning goal, linked to various `LearningActivity` objects.
    - `LearningActivity` class: Represents a piece of learning content (e.g., video, game, worksheet, text) tagged with attributes like `content_type` (e.g., 'visual_interactive', 'textual_explanatory') and `difficulty`.
- **Content Structure:** Content is organized by learning objectives, with each objective having multiple activities catering to different learning preferences and styles.

### 2.3. Dynamic Curriculum Weaving & Adaptive Pathway Generation (DCW-APG) Module
- **File:** `dcw_apg_module.py`
- **Purpose:** To generate a personalized sequence of learning activities for a student based on their learner profile and the available curriculum content.
- **Core Logic:**
    - Takes a `LearnerProfile` object as input.
    - Accesses the `ContentStore` to retrieve relevant learning objectives and activities.
    - For each learning objective in a predefined sequence (for this prototype), it selects the most appropriate `LearningActivity` based on the student's learning preferences (e.g., if the preference is 'visual', it prioritizes activities tagged as 'visual_interactive' or 'video').
    - Generates a simple, ordered pathway of learning objectives and their corresponding selected activities.

### 2.4. Interface Generation Script
- **File:** `generate_interface.py`
- **Purpose:** This Python script dynamically generates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the student interface. It integrates the functionalities of the HLP, Curriculum, and DCW-APG modules to create an interactive experience.
- **Key Functions:**
    - Simulates the HLP interaction (preference selection, interest input, struggle areas).
    - Calls the DCW-APG module to generate a personalized pathway.
    - Embeds the generated profile and pathway into the HTML structure.
    - Includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the "Star Collector" mini-game as a reward mechanism.
    - Writes the complete HTML content to the `dala_student_interface_v6_redesigned.html` file.

### 2.5. Student Interface
- **File:** `dala_student_interface_v6_redesigned.html` (Generated by `generate_interface.py`)
- **Purpose:** To provide a user-facing interactive prototype for students.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Welcome & Introduction:** Greets the student.
    - **Holistic Learner Profile Section:**
        - Interactive elements for selecting learning preferences (e.g., "Learn by Doing" vs. "Learn by Reading").
        - Input for selecting interests from a list.
        - Section to indicate areas of struggle.
    - **Learner Profile Display:** Shows the summarized learner profile based on inputs.
    - **Personalized Learning Pathway:** Displays the sequence of learning objectives and the specific activities chosen for the student by the DCW-APG module.
    - **"Star Collector" Mini-Game:** A simple JavaScript-based game that appears as a reward. Players click on falling stars to collect them within a time limit.
    - **Visual Design:** Features a vibrant, colorful, and engaging design aimed at young learners, with improved layout and typography for better readability and appeal.

## 3. How to Run the Prototype

1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Navigate to the `edpsychconnect_dala_prototype` directory.
3.  Run the interface generation script: `python generate_interface.py`
4.  This will create/update the `interface_prototype/dala_student_interface_v6_redesigned.html` file.
5.  Open `dala_student_interface_v6_redesigned.html` in a web browser to interact with the prototype.

## 4. Key Decisions & Evolution during Stage 1 Development

- **Inclusion of "Struggle Areas":** Based on user feedback, the HLP module and interface were enhanced to allow students to indicate areas where they need the most help. This provides richer data for future personalization.
- **Visual Engagement and Gamification:** Initial feedback highlighted the need for a more engaging interface. This led to significant visual redesigns and the introduction of the "Star Collector" mini-game as a reward mechanism to increase motivation.
The design philosophy shifted towards creating a more playful, colorful, and less cluttered experience.
- **Iterative Design:** The interface went through several versions (v1 to v6), with each iteration incorporating user feedback to improve usability, engagement, and visual appeal.

## 5. Future Considerations (Post-Stage 1)

- **Advanced HLP:** Develop more sophisticated diagnostic tasks and potentially integrate with external assessment data for a richer learner profile.
- **Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech:** Incorporate accessibility features for students with dyslexia or other reading/writing difficulties.
- **Expanded Curriculum & Content:** Digitize a broader range of curriculum topics and content types.
- **Sophisticated DCW-APG Logic:** Implement more complex algorithms for pathway generation, considering factors like prerequisite knowledge, difficulty progression, and student performance feedback.
- **More Advanced Gamification:** Introduce a wider variety of mini-games, progress tracking systems (e.g., visual progress bars, badges), and potentially a narrative or themed learning journey.
- **Educator Dashboard:** Develop a corresponding interface for educators to monitor student progress and manage learning content.
- **Data Persistence:** Implement a database to store learner profiles, progress, and content.
- **Real-time Adaptation:** Enable the system to adapt pathways in real-time based on student interactions and performance within activities.
